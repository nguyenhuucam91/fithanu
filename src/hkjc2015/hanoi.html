	<div class="line"></div>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>Undergoing 1,000 years, witnessing all ups and downs of Vietnam history, Hanoi – a dynamic capital of Vietnam is one of the “most-wanted” destinations which keeps inside many of the historic and cultural vestiges for every foreign tourist who have chance to travel to Vietnam. It is also a pride of Vietnamese people in general and Hanoians in particular.</p></div>    
	<img src="style/images/hanoi_photos/1.jpg" /><br>
	<div class="comments">Van Mieu - Temple of Literature & Ancient National University. It is a temple of Confucius in Hanoi, Vietnam. Although several Van Mieu can be found throughout Vietnam, the most prominent and famous is that situated in the city of Hanoi, which also functioned as Vietnam’s first university. It is featured on the back of the one hundred thousand Vietnamese banknote.</div><br>    

    <div class="intro">
    <p>Hanoi is the perfect foil for the seething mass of humanity that is Ho Chi Minh City. With a population of seven million and a more genteel style than its southern counterpart, Hanoi is the cultural capital of Vietnam and its heart and soul.</p></div>    <img src="style/images/hanoi_photos/2.jpg" /><br>
	<div class="comments">Hoan Kiem Lake meaning “Lake of the Returned Sword” or “Lake of the Restored Sword”, is a lake in the historical center of Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. The lake is one of the major scenic spots in the city and serves as a focal point for its public life.</div><br>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>Previously known as Thang Long, it was renamed Hanoi in 1831 at a time when Hue was the capital. Large areas of present-day Hanoi were built during the French occupation, reflected in its broad boulevards and French-inspired architecture, which give the city a definite charm.</p></div>
    <img src="style/images/hanoi_photos/9.jpg" /><br>
	<div class="comments">The Old Quarter, near Hoan Kiem lake, has the original street layout and architecture of old Hanoi. At the beginning of the 20th century the city consisted of only about 36 streets, most of which are now part of the old quarter. Each street then had merchants and households specialized in a particular trade, such as silk traders, jewellery, etc. The street names nowadays still reflect these specializations, although few of them remain exclusively in their original commerce.</div><br>
    <img src="style/images/hanoi_photos/10.jpg" /><br>
	<div class="comments">The area is famous for its small artisans and merchants, including many silk shops. Local cuisine specialties as well as several clubs and bars can be found here also. A night market (near Xuân market) in the heart of the district opens for business every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening with a variety of clothing, souvenirs and food.</div><br>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>Hanoi is a great place to explore on foot. There is a lot to see and do here. Vietnam’s capital lies on the banks of the Red River, some 100 kilometres from its mouth. Human settlements here date back as far as the 3rd century BC.</p></div>
    <img src="style/images/hanoi_photos/3.jpg" /><br>
	<div class="comments">The West Lake - Ho Tay is the largest of all the lakes in Ha Noi. The lake is on the northwest part of the city. Long ago, the lake was a branch of the Red river but later, as the river changed course, the lake remained a body of water just west of the river.</div><br>   
    <img src="style/images/hanoi_photos/4.jpg" /><br>
	<div class="comments">Water puppetry “puppets that dance on water”) is a tradition that dates back as far as the 11th century CE when it originated in the villages of the Red River Delta area of northern Vietnam. Today’s Vietnamese water puppetry is a unique variation on the ancient Asian puppet tradition.</div><br>   
    <img src="style/images/hanoi_photos/5.jpg" /><br>
	<div class="comments">Bat Trang, a small village in the north of Vietnam, is a popular destination to most tourists to northern Vietnam because of its famous ceramic and pottery products of high quality. If you have known about Vietnam, you may not be surprised that Bat Trang’s vases, bowls, dishes, and many other kinds of ceramic products have been exported worldwide. Should you would like to contemplate workers making ceramic products by hand, just come here! What’s more, you can also try it yourself!</div><br>       

    <div class="intro">
    <p>Nowadays Hanoi is a mix of busy modern life and sustainable values preserved for generations. Despite the noise of seven million residents zipping around on motorbikes, Hanoi still has an intimate urban feel. Living in Hanoi you will discover a city where the modern and ancient merge. Whether you wish to sip coffee by one of its 100 lakes, delve into fascinating history, or explore mega-malls and entertainment complexes, Hanoi really does have something to interest everyone.</p></div>
